Project Summary: Laptop Inventory Management System  

Overview  
This project is a Laptop Inventory Management System designed to facilitate the buying and selling of laptops while maintaining stock records. The system reads available laptop stock from a file, updates stock after purchases or sales, and generates receipts for transactions.  

It follows a menu-driven approach where users can:  
1. View available laptop stock.  
2. Purchase laptops (increase stock).  
3. Sell laptops (decrease stock).  
4. Exit the system.  

The project ensures accurate stock management and provides transaction records via text files.  

Key Features  

1. Stock Management:  
- Reads laptop stock data from a file (laptop_stock.txt).  
- Stores stock information in a nested dictionary for efficient data handling.  
- Displays formatted stock details, including laptop name, brand, price, quantity, processor, and graphics card.  

2. Selling Laptops:  
- Users can enter the laptop name and quantity they wish to purchase.  
- Validates stock availability before processing the sale.  
- Deducts the purchased quantity from stock.  
- Option for shipping with an additional fixed cost of $100.  
- Generates a sales receipt stored in sell_slip.txt.  

3. Buying Laptops (Stock Replenishment):  
- Allows stock managers to add more laptops to inventory.  
- Asks for producer name and laptop details.  
- Updates stock quantity after purchase.  
- Applies a 13% VAT charge on the total price.  
- Generates a purchase receipt stored in purchase_slip.txt.  

4. Transaction Receipts:  
- Sales and purchase transactions generate detailed receipts.  
- Receipts contain the buyer/seller name, product details, total price, VAT, shipping cost (if applicable), and timestamps.  
- Stored as text files for future reference.  

5. Error Handling & Validations:  
- Handles invalid user inputs (e.g., non-integer quantities).  
- Prevents selling more items than available in stock.  
- Ensures stock is updated correctly after each transaction.  

Technologies Used  

Programming Language:  
- Python: Used for writing the entire backend logic and implementing file handling.  

Development Environment:  
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code): The primary IDE used for development.  

File Handling:  
- Reads stock data from laptop_stock.txt.  
- Updates stock after transactions.  
- Stores sales and purchase receipts in text files.  

Data Structures Used:  
- Dictionaries: Store laptop stock details efficiently.  
- Strings: Used for formatted output and file handling.  
- Lists: Handle menu-driven options.  

Python Libraries Used:  
- datetime: To generate timestamps for receipts.  

Conclusion  
This Laptop Inventory Management System efficiently manages stock, processes sales and purchases, and generates receipts using Python and VS Code. It demonstrates the practical use of file handling, error handling, dictionary-based data management, and formatted output generation. While Python is ideal for small-scale inventory systems, enterprise solutions would benefit from database integration and a web-based interface for better scalability.
